# üêâ PetRealm

## Project Overview

PetRealm is a virtual mythical pet simulation where players can adopt, care for, and interact with magical creatures. Each pet has a hunger system that gradually decreases over time, encouraging regular feeding to keep them happy and healthy. The game blends fantasy with simple mechanics, making it a fun and engaging experience.
