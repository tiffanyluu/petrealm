# üêâ PetRealm

## Project Overview

PetRealm is a virtual mythical pet simulation where players can adopt, care for, and interact with magical creatures. Each pet has a hunger system that gradually decreases over time, encouraging regular feeding to keep them happy and healthy.

**Live Demo:** [PetRealm on Vercel](https://petrealm.vercel.app/)
